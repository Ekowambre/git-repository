This Terraform code provisions a GitHub repository with branches, branch protections, pull request templates, teams, and their permissions, as well as workflows and jobs for Terraform operations. It also sets up branch protection rules and creates GitHub secrets for the repository.

The provider block specifies that the GitHub provider will be used and requires a token for authentication.

The code provisions a GitHub repository named "template" with a description.

It creates a branch named "development" in the repository.

The "github_branch_default" resource sets the development branch as the default branch for the repository.

It creates a branch named "main" in the repository.

It creates a branch named "feature" in the repository.

The "github_branch_protection" resource enables branch protection on the development branch, requiring at least one code owner review and dismissing stale reviews.

The "github_repository_pull_request" resource creates a pull request from the "feature-branch" to the "development" branch.

Two users, "SomeUser" and "AnotherUser," are added as members of the organization with the role of "member."

A team named "SomeTeam" is created with a description.

Users "SomeUser" and "AnotherUser" are added as members of "SomeTeam" with roles "maintainer" and "member" respectively.

The code defines three teams: "engineering_team," "codeowners," and "architects," with their respective names and descriptions.

The teams are added to the "template" repository with specific permissions ("push" for "engineers_team" and "pull" for "codeowners_team" and "architects_team").

A pull request template is defined using the "github_repository_pull_request_template" resource.

A branch protection rule is defined for the "development" and "main" branches, requiring at least one approving review and status checks before merging.

A workflow named "Terraform Workflow" is defined that triggers on a push event and resolves to the "terraform-apply" job.

Three jobs ("terraform-validate," "terraform-plan," and "terraform-apply") are defined within the workflow. These jobs perform Terraform validation, planning, and apply operations.

Branch protection rules are defined for the "development" and "main" branches, enforcing status checks, and requiring at least one approving review.

GitHub secrets are created for the "template" repository. Here, an AWS credentials secret is defined.

Teams named "Code Owners," "Engineers," and "Architects" are created with "closed" privacy.

The teams are added to the "template" repository with specific permissions ("pull" for "codeowners_repo" and "push" for "engineers_repo" and "architects_repo").

The "github_branch_protection" resource is used to enable branch protection on the "development" branch, requiring at least one code owner review, dismissing stale reviews, and enforcing strict status checks.
